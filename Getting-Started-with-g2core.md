G2core is an Open Source CNC, 3D Printer, and general stepper-motor-based motion control firmware that runs on the next generation of g2core hardware as well as the Arduino Due.

## Hardware Needed To Use g2core
You will need whatever machine you are trying to control, such as a CNC machine, 3D printer, laser cutter, etc., along with the general knowledge of how to use that machine safely.

You will also need software to generate GCode.

The following is a list of the minimum you will need strictly for g2core, regardless of what project you'll be using it for.

**Compatible Target Board** - [Arduino Due](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardDue) ($50) ([Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1076), [Maker Shed](http://www.makershed.com/Arduino_Due_p/mksp16.htm), [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11589), [Digi-Key](https://www.digikey.com/product-highlights/us/en/arduino-arduino-due-board/2831), [Mouser](http://www.mouser.com/new/arduino/arduino-due/), [Newark](http://www.newark.com/arduino/a000062/dev-brd-sam3x8e-arm-cortex-m3/dp/47W2961))
* Currently the only publicly-available board g2core works on is the Arduino Due.

**Adapter Cabling/Shield** - gShield ($50) ([Synthetos Store](https://synthetos.myshopify.com/products/gshield-v5), [Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1750), [Inventables](https://www.inventables.com/technologies/gshield)), or roll-your-own cabling.
* Depending on the project and your level of expertise, you may be able to wire stepper drivers you already have (as long as they have STEP/DIRECTION/ENABLE pinouts) to the Due or roll your own shield.
â€¢ The gShield provides three stepper drivers and pinouts for spindle controls and limit switches.

**Debugger/Programmer** - Atmel-ICE debugger on [Mouser](http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Atmel/ATATMEL-ICE-BASIC/?qs=sGAEpiMZZMsn4IaorHFpMNdmy%252bJMuxsJtWHi7YhUN7M%3d) and  [Digikey](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/atmel/ATATMEL-ICE-BASIC/ATATMEL-ICE-BASIC-ND/4753381). 
* You _can_ program the Due and the TinyG v9 boards without a debugger, but to do realtime debugging you need an ICE of some sort. 
* Note that the Atmel-ICE is not the Atmel _SAM-ICE_ or the Atmel _JTAG-ICE_. The Atmel SAM-ICE will work as well, but is older and more expensive. All the examples on this site use the Atmel-ICE.

## Software Needed To Use g2core

If you are _not_ planning on compiling the firmware yourself, then all you need the the Arduino 1.5+ IDE installed on your machine (for the `bossac` binary). You can then program any provided hex directly onto the Due or TinyG v9.
