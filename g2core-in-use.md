g2core is in use by people all over the world

This page links to the users we know about.  If your project, business, (etc) uses g2core, then please add yourself here.  Preferably with video (of g2core in use), or even helpful instructions for others to do the same. :smile:

Also, if you know of other projects, people, businesses (etc) using g2core who aren't listed, here, please feel welcome to add them.

**Note that this page is very new, and is only just starting to have entries added**

## Products

### Current

* [Printrbot Simple Pro](https://printrbot.com/new-simple-pro/)
* [Printrbot CNC v2](https://printrbot.com/shop/printrbot-cnc-v2-bare-bones-beta-kit/)

### Future

* [ShopBot](http://www.shopbottools.com/mApplications/developers.htm) appear to be basing future products on g2core

### Older

* The [Othermill](https://www.bantamtools.com/pages/products) - Uses TinyG as the electronic controller.
  * This was superseded by the Othermill Pro, which was itself superseded by the "Bantam Tools Desktop PCB Milling Machine".  Not sure (yet) if TinyG or G2core is used, but am looking into it.


## Video's

### Things being created, where g2core is part of the process

* Golf putters by [Honu Putters](https://www.honuputters.com).  Reported [here](https://github.com/synthetos/g2/issues/296#issuecomment-381199892) by [@MitchBradley](https://github.com/MitchBradley) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoLG7eB8SuI
  * `In that video, the milling is done with Mach3 but since then I have built a new shop that is specialized for putters, converted my Taig mill to a g2core/Due/RaspberryPi/cncjs controller, and added several cnc processes to replace manual shaping.`
