### Things being created, where g2core is part of the process

* Golf putters by [Honu Putters](https://www.honuputters.com).  Reported [here](https://github.com/synthetos/g2/issues/296#issuecomment-381199892) by [@MitchBradley](https://github.com/MitchBradley) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoLG7eB8SuI
  * `In that video, the milling is done with Mach3 but since then I have built a new shop that is specialized for putters, converted my Taig mill to a g2core/Due/RaspberryPi/cncjs controller, and added several cnc processes to replace manual shaping.`
