# What's Needed To Compile G2 On OS X (with Xcode)

First, you will need to install XCode ([Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)). Luckily, it's free.

_If you wish to use the OS X command line, then visit [[Compiling G2 on OS X and Linux (command line)]] as well._

# Cloning the git repository.

The easiest way on OS X to clone the git repo is probably to:

1. Download and install the [GitHub app](https://mac.github.com/).
2. Log into the GitHub web site -- register if needed, it's free.
3. Browse to the G2 project page and then click on the <a href="github-mac://openRepo/https://github.com/synthetos/g2" data-url="github-mac://openRepo/https://github.com/synthetos/g2" class="minibutton sidebar-button js-conduit-rewrite-url" title="Save synthetos/g2 to your computer and use it in GitHub Desktop." aria-label="Save synthetos/g2 to your computer and use it in GitHub Desktop."><span class="octicon octicon-device-desktop"></span>Clone in Desktop</a> button.
