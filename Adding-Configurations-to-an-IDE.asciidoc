This page explains how to create or change Configurations to one of the two supported IDEs: Xcode and Atmel Studio 7.

// So far there are only two topics, and the first is real short
// So we don't need a Table of Contents.

# Adding a new Target and Scheme to Xcode

First, create the new files for the board and config as described in link:Adding-and-Revising-Boards[Adding and Revising Boards] and related pages. Then go to link:Compiling-g2core-on-OS-X-(with-Xcode)#creating-a-new-target[Creating a new target].

# Adding a new Profile to Atmel Studio 7

First, create the new files for the board and config as described in link:Adding-and-Revising-Boards[Adding and Revising Boards] and related pages.

Once you have everything you need to build a new config or board then follow these steps, being very careful to follow them carefully. Atmel Studio 7 project and solution files can be broken pretty easily!

[INFO]
====
Atmel Studio has two levels of settings: *Solution*, and *Project*.

A *solution* may configure many projects.

The *project* holds the actual configuration for the build.

You cannot have a project that is outside of a solution. When building you choose a solution, which then chooses the project(s).

So, we will make a solution that has no other job than to hold a project _that has the same name_, then we will configure that project.

Once that's done you will likely forget the difference between a solution and a project.
====

* Make sure you have to solution open in Atmel Studio 7, and the projects `g2core` and `Motate` both opened successfully.
+
TIP: If you don't have Atmel Studio 7, please visit link:Compiling-g2core-on-Windows-10-and-Atmel-Studio-7[Compiling g2core on Windows 10 and Atmel Studio 7]
+
TIP: If the Motate project shows as unable to load, you may not have the Motate submodule loaded. See link:Troubleshooting#problem-the-motate-directory-is-empty-the-motate-project-is-missing["Problem: The Motate directory is empty. The Motate project is missing."] on our Troubleshooting page.

* Under the *Build* menu, choose "Configuration Manager..."

* Under the "Active solution configuration" menu (see image) choose "<New...>"

+
WARNING: There are a few other menus in this windows that look very similar and have the same options at the bottom. Make sure you get the right one!

* A "New Solution Configuration" dialog should appear. _Double-check the dialog name to make sure you didn't accidentally choose "New..." from the wrong menu._
+

** Enter the Name of your new solution configuration. It should consist of only letters, numbers, dashes (`-`), underscores (`_)`, and dots (`.`). It's probably best to keep it all lowercase if you can.
+
TIP: We generally try to name these in the style of __machine__-__board__, where __machine__ matches the `SETTINGS_FILE` (without the `_settings.h` suffix) name, and board matches the `BOARD` value.

** ðŸ”¥ Be sure that the "Create new project configuration" is *not checked*.

** Choose another solution with a similar board (most any will likely do) from the "Copy settings from:" menu.

** Click "OK".

** Verify that the "Active solution configuration" is the solution you just created.

* In the `g2core` row (*not* the `Motate` row!), in the Configuration column, click and choose "<New...>" from the bottom of the menu. (See image for clarification.)
** Alternately, select the Solution name in the drop list and skip the rest of this step

+
IMPORTANT: Be very careful not to choose the wrong cell! Several of them have a "<New..>" at the bottom of the menu!

* A "New Project Configuration" dialog should appear. _Double-check the dialog name._
+

** Add the name for your new project. You should make this the same as the new solution you just created.

** ðŸ”¥ Be sure that the "Create new project configuration" is *not checked*.

** Choose another project with a similar board (most any will likely do) from the "Copy settings from:" menu.

** Click "OK".

** Verify that the `g2core`/Configuration is showing your new configuration.

** Click "Close" on the Configuration Manager.

* Right click on `g2core` in the Solution Explorer and choose Properties...

** In the properties window, choose the "Build" tab on the left (yes, those are tabs), and then modify the Build command line and Clean command line to match your new config/board/settings.
+

+
TIP: The clean command must have the same `CONFIG`/`BOARD` as the make line in order to delete the correct files. See link:Adding-and-Revising-Boards#cleaning-up[Cleaning Up] for more info.

* Under File, choose "Save All" to make sure your changes are committed to disk.

** You may also want to commit the Atmel Studio project file changes in git as well.
