This page is mostly a placeholder for now, but there are a few important pieces of information

We use Coolterm to connect to G2 for testing. 

* For OSX please use Coolterm version 1.4.3. There is a bug in the latest version and 1.4.3 is the latest we have tested that works well. (A bug has been opened with the author who has supported us extremely well throughout this project)

* The usb will com up as 2 devices labeled something like:
  * usbmodem14311
  * usbmodem14313

These are the 2 endpoints for the dual endpoint USB connection. You can connect to either and it will work.
