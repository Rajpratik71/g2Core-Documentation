This page describes how to program the TinyG v9 (or Due) using the ERASE / bootloader option on the Atmel SAM ARM chip. If you are looking to program using a SAM-ICE from Atmel Studio 6, please see [here](https://github.com/synthetos/g2/wiki/Programming-v9-with-Studio6-and-the-SAM-ICE)
   
Please note: We do not yet have instructions for Windows or Linux, but the steps are similar.
