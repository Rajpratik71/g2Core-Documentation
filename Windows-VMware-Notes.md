This is a notes page for things I found when installing and using the Windows dev environment. Presumably relevant portions of this page will be extracted and turned into real project documentation later.

Notes:

- If you switch to AS6 from a branch that was in AS7 you need to do the following:
  - Delete the .atsuo files in both the TinyG directory
  - Rename Motate.cppproj to Motate_AS7.cppproj. Copy and rename Motate_6_2.cppproj to Motate.cppproj
