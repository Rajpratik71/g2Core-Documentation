This is a notes page for things I found when installing and using the Windows dev environment. Presumably relevant portions of this page will be extracted and turned into real project documentation later.

Notes:

- If you switch to AS6 from a branch that was in AS7 you need to delete the .atsuo files in both the g2 and Motate directories, or the project will not load into AS6
