###Hardware
You will need the following hw and configuration
* TinyGv9 board
* Atmel-ICE debugger
* Both plugged into an OSX machine via USB, preferably without a hub. See the [Apple] / About this Mac / More Info / System Report / USB section. Hit command R if you want to refresh. Some times getting these connected takes some unplugging and replugging to get USB to behave.

###Install
1. Install hombrew: http://brew.sh/
   Look for "Install Homebrew‚Äù near the bottom of that page. Follow those instructions in Terminal.<br>
<pre>
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
</pre>
As instructed, run `brew doctor` before you install anything, and 
install the Command Line Tools for Xcode: https://developer.apple.com/downloads. Search "Command Line Tools for Xcode". You may need to register as an Apple Developer for this step.

2. In terminal, run:<br>
`brew install openocd`

3. cd into the <project>/TinyG2/ directory, have the V9 all wired up and run:<br>
`make VERBOSE=2 PLATFORM=G2v9i debug`

That should have you debugging in gdb. If you get connection errors make sure the Atmel-ICE is connected as in Hardware, above.

Notes:
* This is Embedded GDB, so some command sin the cheat sheets do not work:
  * `run`
* Some useful commands
  * `monitor reset halt` to reset
