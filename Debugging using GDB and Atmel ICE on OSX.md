###Install
1. Install hombrew: http://brew.sh/
   Look for "Install Homebrew‚Äù near the bottom of that page. Follow those instructions in Terminal.<br>
<pre>
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
</pre>
As instructed, run `brew doctor` before you install anything, and 
install the Command Line Tools for Xcode: https://developer.apple.com/downloads. Search "Command Line Tools for Xcode". You may need to register as an Apple Developer for this step.

2. In terminal, run:<br>
`brew install openocd`

3. cd into the <project>/TinyG2/ directory, have the V9 all wired up and run:<br>
`make VERBOSE=2 PLATFORM=G2v9i debug`

That should have you debugging in gdb. 

If you get connection errors make sure the Atmel-ICE is connected. Look at the System Report / USB section (command R to refresh). Some times this takes some unplugging and replugging to get USB to behave. make sure the TinyGv2 device is also connected.
