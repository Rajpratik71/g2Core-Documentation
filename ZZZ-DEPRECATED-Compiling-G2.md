## Compiling G2
To learn how to compile the g2 codebase for your specific platform please follow the links below.  Also please note that as of Nov. 1st 2015 ***g2 does not currently have the ability to change the "burned in" settings that you flash to the board***.  If you would like to create custom settings that persist a reboot / power loss of the g2 board, then you will need to create your own settings file, compile and flash that image onto your hardware.  The links below will help you achieve this.

### OSX with Xcode:
If you want to compile the g2 codebase on OSX using Mac's Xcode IDE then follow this link to get setup. hardware debugging is also covered.

- [Debugging G2 on OSX with GDB and Atmel ICE](Debugging-G2-on-OSX-with-GDB-and-Atmel-ICE)

### Linux & OSX from command line:
If you want to compile the g2 codebase on Linux or OSX using a terminal then follow this link.

### Windows with Atmel Studio:
The only supported method of compiling the g2 codebase from Windows is using Atmel Studio. As of firmware build 101 we are supporting Windows 10 and Atmel Studio 7 only.
