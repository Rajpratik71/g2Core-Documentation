# --- DRAFT ---
_**This page discusses proposed changes to the branching and release scheme for g2core. Please feel free to comment and edit.**_

# Current Branch and Release
* Master branch - is the stable release branch. Pushes to master are performed periodically as code gets sufficient field history from early adopters of edge code
* Edge branch - is the working branch. Bug and feature updates are performed against this branch. 
* Issue-NNN branches - are created to work on bugs or features. These are pulled into edge via pull requests. 
* Dev branches - The Dev prefix has been deprecated, but you may still see some dev branches around.
