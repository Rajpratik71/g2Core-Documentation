# Compiling G2 from source

## Tools needed

**Debugger/Programmer** (Not strictly necessary, but very helpful) - [Atmel-ICE](http://www.atmel.com/tools/atatmel-ice.aspx).
* There are three ways they sell the Atmel-ICE: [Standard ($85)](http://store.atmel.com/PartDetail.aspx?q=p:10500375#tc:description), [Basic ($49)](http://store.atmel.com/PartDetail.aspx?q=p:10500377#tc:description), and [PCBA ($32)](http://store.atmel.com/PartDetail.aspx?q=p:10500376#tc:description). The standard comes with an adapter that you won't need for this project, and the PCBA is missing the $14 cable you _will_ need for the project, so the Basic is just right.
* This is not the Atmel _SAM-ICE_ or the Atmel _JTAG-ICE_, but just the _Atmel-ICE_. The Atmel SAM-ICE will work as well, but is older and more expensive, but has the advantage of being a (Atmel-limited) Segger J-Link. We will document here how to use the Atmel-ICE.
