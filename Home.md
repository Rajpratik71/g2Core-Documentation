Welcome to the g2 wiki!

This wiki documents the TinyG ARM port, which we are calling G2. G2 is pre-release as not all of [TinyG's](https://github.com/synthetos/TinyG) features are in it yet, but we have been working on it for over a year now and it's pretty stable for what it does do.

This wiki serves as a user and programmer manual and documents progress on the project. We (Synthetos) maintain the wiki, but it's an open wiki. If you want to post wiki-type stuff feel free to do it here. Please let us know via a github Issue if it's anything that needs active attention - Issues are good for requested changes, discussions and bona-fide software bugs.
