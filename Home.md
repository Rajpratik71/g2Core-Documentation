Welcome to the g2 wiki!

This wiki documents the TinyG ARM port, which we are calling G2. 

This wiki serves as a user and programmer manual and documents progress on the project. We (Synthetos) maintain the wiki, but it's an open wiki. If you want to post wiki-type stuff feel free to do it here. Please let us know via a github Issue if it's anything that needs active attention - Issues are good for requested changes, discussions and bona-fide software bugs.
