Welcome to the g2 wiki!

This wiki documents the TinyG ARM port, which we are calling g2core. 

This wiki serves as a user and programmer manual and documents progress on the project. We (Synthetos) maintain the wiki, but it's an open wiki. If you want to post wiki-type stuff feel free to do it here. Please let us know via a github Issue if it's anything that needs active attention - Issues are good for requested changes, discussions and bona-fide software bugs.

###Current State of g2core
The [Master](https://github.com/synthetos/g2/tree/master) branch contains the current stable code. New feature development takes place in various feature branches which are then promoted to the [Edge](https://github.com/synthetos/g2/tree/edge) branch to make them available for beta testing.

Currently the [Master](https://github.com/synthetos/g2/tree/master) branch has the 100.xx firmware builds. The firmware version is 0.99. The firmware version indicates the configuration and UI compatibility. Please note the changes in the Readme.md for the respective branch.
