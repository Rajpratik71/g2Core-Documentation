Welcome to the g2 wiki!

This wiki documents the TinyG ARM port, which we are calling g2core. 

This wiki serves as a user and programmer manual and documents progress on the project. We (Synthetos) maintain the wiki, but it's an open wiki. If you want to post wiki-type stuff feel free to do it here. Please let us know via a github Issue if it's anything that needs active attention - Issues are good for requested changes, discussions and bona-fide software bugs.

_The current best place to work from for g2core is the edge-100 branch, firmware version 0.99. FV 0.99 is currently undergoing testing. We are pretty comfortable with its functionality and stability, but have a few more functions to install and test before it's promoted to the edge branch. After a soak time in edge it will be promoted to the master branch_
