# Locating or creating the binary to upload

You must either download or build the binary to be uploaded to the board. Make sure you get the correct binary for the board you are uploading to. For a DUE with a gShield (a.k.a. GRBL Shield), it will be labelled as "gShield." For any version of TinyG v9 (prototypes, at this point), it will be labelled with the prototype revision, such as  "G2v9g."
