## Compiling G2
To learn how to compile the g2 codebase for your specific platform please follow the links below.  Also please note that as of Nov. 1st 2015 ***g2 does not currently have the ability to change the "burned in" settings that you flash to the board***.  If you would like to create custom settings that persist a reboot / power loss of the g2 board, then you will need to create your own settings file, compile and flash that image onto your hardware.  The links below will help you achieve this.

### OSX with Xcode:
If you want to compile the g2 codebase on OSX using Mac's Xcode IDE then follow this link to get setup.
