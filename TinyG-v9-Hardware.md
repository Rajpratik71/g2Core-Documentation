Molex 26-60-4040      4 position straight header
Molex 26-60-5040      4 position right angle header

Mating parts are:
Molex 09-50-3041     4 position housing
Molex 08-50-0134     crimp terminal (4 required per plug)

- The power connector can be plugged with either a standard 5.00 mm screw terminal block or
