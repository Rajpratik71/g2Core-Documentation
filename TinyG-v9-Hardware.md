This page contains general information about TinyG v9 hardware. 

_PRELIMINARY - This is still being iterated_

TinyG v9 is intended for use by individuals building a system, as well as by system manufacturers looking to reduce costs in assembly and maintenance while maintaing high reliability. TinyG v9 has a number of features designed to support these 2 (sometime competing) goals. In general, there are choices for how to assemble and use the IO connectors.

### Power Connector

The power connector can be populated with either a standard 5.00 mm screw terminal block or a straight or right angle 2 position friction lock header. The friction lock header is rated for 7 amps, so if you are using NEMA23 motors (or larger) we recommend using the screw terminal option. 

Friction Lock Header (Molex parts are listed but any equivalent part should work)
* Molex 171813-0002     2 position right angle header
* Molex 171814-0002     2 position right angle header

Mating parts are:
* Molex 09-50-3021     2 position housing
* Molex 08-50-0134     crimp terminal (2 required per plug)

### Motor Connectors

The v9 has a dual hole patterns for motors. It will accommodate 3.81mm screw terminals but can also be populated for vertical or right angle 0.156 friction lock headers. 

Friction Lock Headers
* Molex 26-60-4040      4 position straight header
* Molex 26-60-5040      4 position right angle header

Mating parts are:
* Molex 09-50-3041     4 position housing
* Molex 08-50-0134     crimp terminal (4 required per plug)
